# Logistic Regression

## The Big Picture

`linfa-logistic` is a crate in the [`linfa`](https://crates.io/crates/linfa) ecosystem, an effort to create a toolkit for classical Machine Learning implemented in pure Rust, akin to Python's `scikit-learn`.

## Current state
`linfa-logistic` provides a pure Rust implementation of a two class logistic regression model.
