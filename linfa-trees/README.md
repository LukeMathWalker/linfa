# Decision tree learning

`linfa-trees` provides methods for decision tree learning algorithms.

## The Big Picture

`linfa-trees` is a crate in the [`linfa`](https://crates.io/crates/linfa) ecosystem, an effort to create a toolkit for classical Machine Learning implemented in pure Rust, akin to Python's `scikit-learn`.

## Current state

`linfa-trees` currently provides an implementation of single tree fitting

## Examples

There is an example in the `examples/` directory how to use decision trees. To run, use:

```bash
$ cargo run --release --example decision_tree
```
