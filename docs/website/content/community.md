Linfa provides a framework for statistical learning to the Rust community. As such our raison d'Ãªtre is to help others implementing their algorithms, ensuring a quality standard in documentation and providing guidelines with best-practices in context of the Rust language.

A welcoming, friendly and safe environment is very important to use and we are striving to make the community as inclusive and open as possible. As such the implementation and communication is happening in the open with the possibility for anyone to participate.

## Providing knowledge

In previous encounters we experienced two ways we could help people. One motivation of people is to implement expertise in Rust to try out the language. The other for those who want to get involved in statistical/machine learning and are looking for an interesting paper to start with.

If you happen to belong to the first group, then please reach out on [Zulip](https://rust-ml.zulip.org) or open a pull request if you wish for feedback. If you are looking for a topic you can either reach out on [Zulip](https://rust-ml.zulip.org) as well, ask the maintainer directly per [Mail](mailto:lorenz.schmidt@mailbox.org) or look into the [roadmap](https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa/issues/7).

## Platforms

There are two ways you can reach us:
 * say hello on [Zulip](https://rust-ml.zulip.org)
 * or participate in our [Github issues](https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa/issues)
