Linfa provides a framework for statistical learning to the Rust community. As such our raison d'Ãªtre is to help others implementing their algorithms and provide guidelines with best-practices in the context of Rust. 

A welcoming, friendly and safe environment is very important to use and we are striving to make the community as inclusive and open as possible.
