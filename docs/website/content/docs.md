# API documentation

You can find the latests API documentation [here](https://docs.rs/linfa/).

# Examples

A good way to start is by looking at code examples. You can find them in the *examples/* folder of each sub-crate. To give an example, for Support Vector Machines take a look [here](https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa/tree/master/linfa-svm/examples).

# How do contribute

If you want to know how to integrate something into Linfa, take a look at the *CONTRIBUTE.md* page in the Github repository [here](https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md). This covers topics on the type system implementation, how to use datasets, add parameters to your algorithm, etc.

# Understanding the theory

A good book I can recommend anyone with knowledge of undergraduate information/probability theory and linear algebra is the *Elements of Statistical Learning* by Friedman, Tibshirani and Hastie. You can find the free version [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/).
